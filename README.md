https://rome.tools/blog/2020/08/08/introducing-rome

> Rome is designed to replace Babel, ESLint, Webpack, Prettier, Jest, and others.

> Rome unifies functionality that has previously been separate tools. Building upon a shared base allows us to provide a cohesive experience for processing code, displaying errors, parallelizing work, caching, and configuration.
